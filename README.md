Learning git
Trying to lear how to  create a branch make some changes, commit them and create a pull request
Updating file in github and  now would pull changes to my local clone of this  repository.
Again editing this file  in Github to see if  I can pull changes from here to my local repository without  merging them to master.

trying to see the situation when i do not pull the latest code from central repo and try to push my code  to central repo what happens
